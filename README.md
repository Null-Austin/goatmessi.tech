Idk what to write here, so I'll write the timeline of this project.

I was in a health based class, and were asked a question about who we thought the most physically active people were. My friend sitting next to me called out Messi, someone who he loves and that is something super cool for him!

After class, I had a weird idea, asked him what domain name I should get regarding Messi, and he chose messiisthegoat.tech, I pushed him into something shorter and more memoriable, and we chose GOATMessi.tech!

After class, we seperated for the day cause of opposite classes, and I decided to code some more in my free time, I made a simple ugly looking grid that you can find in the early commits. But, it was the base, and the next time I got free time was when i finally got home, and since then I have programmed this awesome mess! Please dont look at index.scss, its a disaster.
